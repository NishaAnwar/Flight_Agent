This project is an intelligent flight booking assistant built using LangChain, Google Gemini API, and the Bookme flight API. It accepts natural language queries and automatically extracts flight details, authenticates the user, and fetches available flight options.

**Note**:
Don't forget to enter your Bookme username and password in the authentication_tool, and provide your Gemini API key in the environment before running the agent.
